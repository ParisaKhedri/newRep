Robots pits you against evil robots, who are trying to kill you (which
is why they are evil). Fortunately for you, even though they are evil,
they are not very bright and have a habit of bumping into each other,
thus destroying themselves. In order to survive, you must get them to
kill each other off, since you have no offensive weaponry.
Since you are stuck without offensive weaponry, you are endowed with
one piece of defensive weaponry: a teleportation device. When two
robots run into each other or a junk pile, they die. If a robot runs
into you, you die. When a robot dies, you get 10 points, and when all
the robots die, you start on the next field. This keeps up until they
finally get you.
